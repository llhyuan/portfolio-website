            Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr
            themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web
            development. Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of
            building software for an advertising agency, a start-up, a
            student-led design studio, and a huge corporation.

            My main focus these days is building products and leading projects
            for our clients at Upstatement. In my free time I&apos;ve also
            released an online video course that covers everything you need to
            know to build a web app with the Spotify API.
